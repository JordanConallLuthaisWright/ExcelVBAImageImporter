# Excel Image Importer with VBA

## Overview
The **Excel Image Importer** is a VBA macro designed to automate the process of importing images into Excel. This tool allows users to organize images in a structured manner, placing each image in its own cell with a comment section in the adjacent column. The macro ensures professional formatting with consistent sizing, aspect ratio preservation, and borders for better organization and presentation.

## Features
- **Batch Import:** Automatically imports all images from a specified folder.
- **Custom Sizing:** Resizes images to fit cells while maintaining their original aspect ratio.
- **Professional Borders:** Adds clean borders around the image and comment cells.
- **Comment Section:** Creates a dedicated column for user comments next to each image.
- **Multi-Format Support:** Supports popular image formats like `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.bmp`, and `.gif`.

## Use Cases
This tool can be used for a variety of purposes:
- Documenting and annotating **building defects** (e.g., for architects or contractors).
- Managing **product images** for inventory or presentation purposes.
- Creating structured **visual reports** for business or personal projects.

2. Each image is inserted into **Column A**, resized to a manageable size (100x100 pixels by default).
3. A comment cell is added in **Column B** next to the image for annotations.
4. Borders are applied to both the image and comment cells for a clean, professional look.
